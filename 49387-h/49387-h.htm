<p><span class="smcap">Seeing</span> is believing! Such is an old saw, not
usually called in question, and yet it is exceedingly
fallacious. A great many phenomena seemingly
true by the eyesight are not true at all. Ignorance
and prejudice have led to very extraordinary
mistakes. We speak of the sun rising and setting,
because it appears to do so, but it neither sets
nor rises. The earth turns in front of it like
a roast turning before a fire. A conjurer will
clearly shew you that he will bring any number
of eggs out of an empty hat. He only brings
them out of his sleeve, where they were cunningly
concealed. And so on with a great many other
illusions, all seemingly fair and above board, but
in which we are imposed on either by our senses,
or by some fallacy in reasoning. Less than two
hundred years ago, courts of justice were hanging
and burning thousands of old women for being
witches&mdash;all on a sort of evidence which in the
present day would only be laughed at. The world
now knows better than believe such trash, but it
took a long time to learn; and even yet this highly
experienced and much complimented world occasionally
falls into the most absurd crazes; or
perhaps we should more correctly say, there are
large numbers of tolerably educated but credulous
people who with a taste for the wonderful are ever
ready to believe in any kind of nonsense that
turns up. These worthy individuals are, of course,
not without excuse. Starting with the principle
that there may be forces in nature which science
has as yet failed to disclose, we should be cautious
in asserting that any particular phenomenon that
seems incomprehensible is a result of mere illusion
or imposture. Let every mysterious demonstration,
they say, be impartially inquired into. Quite
correct. The misfortune, however, is, that before
the matters in question have been examined
impartially by the light of science, the craze gets
ahead, and many persons weakly allowing themselves
to be carried away by their feelings, get
painfully compromised, and are by the more cool
and cautious part of mankind set down as little
better than&mdash;fools. Very hard! But the warning
offered is useful. If people of good standing will
believe in absurdities without proper examination,
they must take the consequences.</p>

<p>We have been led to make these remarks by a
perusal of the lately issued work, <i>Mesmerism,
Spiritualism, &amp;c., Historically and Scientifically considered</i>,
by Dr W. B. Carpenter. In this ably
written and eminently readable small volume, the
author brings to bear a long experience in scientific
inquiry into the popular crazes and impostures
of the last forty years, beginning with Mesmerism
and Table-turning, and ending with Spiritualism in
the several shapes it has assumed. We commend the
book to the serious consideration of the credulous.
Tracing the history of marvels of different kinds,
Dr Carpenter states that the whole has been 'a
long succession of epidemic delusions, the form of
which has changed from time to time, whilst their
essential nature has remained the same throughout;
and that the condition which underlies them
all is <i>the subjection of the mind to a dominant idea</i>.
There is a constitutional tendency in many minds
to be seized by some strange notion which takes
entire possession of them; so that all the actions
of the individual "thus possessed" are results of its
operation.' Placed on this footing, the Predominant
Delusion, be it a belief in witchcraft, mesmerism,
or spiritualism, is a kind of monomaniacal
frenzy. An absurd idea has got possession of
the individual, and no reasoning with him to the
contrary will have any effect in driving it out.
He will absolutely get out of temper if his fanciful
notions are so much as questioned. Usually the
monomania spreads; and the more who suffer
themselves to be affected, the keener and more
demonstrative does the delusion become. Certain
frantic religious ferments in past and recent times
have been due to nothing else than strange contagious
influences, of which, after a time, when
passion has subsided, all are pretty well ashamed,
and fain to stifle out of disagreeable remembrance.
We happen to have seen several of these prevalent
crazes, droll in some respects, but very pitiable.
After such mental disturbances, things, happily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">{482}</a></span>
shake themselves right at last, and all goes on as
usual. The fever has subsided.</p>

<p>Often, able and estimable men suffer themselves
to be affected by the prevailing craze, and lead on
others as imitators. It is now about forty years
since, when by invitation to a friend's house, we
were present at an evening séance in which an
eminent professor at one of our universities
entertained the company with what he confidently
believed to be mesmeric experiments, such as
sending persons to sleep, or rendering them temporarily
mute by bidding them 'tie their tongue.'
Here was a man skilled in a branch of physical
science, but of eager temperament and with a rage
for novelty, lending himself indiscreetly to certain
popular delusions which had originated in the
crazed fancy of a charlatan. Mesmeric experiments
of this sort were for a time a favourite
amusement. They reminded us of the superstition
in the old legends, in which 'glamour' is said
to have been cast over weak-minded individuals.
This ancient glamour consisted in producing by
looks and gestures a negation of self-assertion.
The operator threw the patient into a kind of
spell-bound or dreamy condition without any
power of correct reasoning. It was the conquest
of the strong and resolute will over the weak
and irresolute, through the effects of a kind of
jugglery.</p>

<p>Mesmeric sleep, as it is called, is ordinarily
produced by seemingly mystic passes of the
hands, and an intense concentration of looks
on the eyes of the person operated upon. In it
there is nothing marvellous. Dr Carpenter explains
that it 'corresponds precisely in character
with what is known in medicine as "hysteric
coma;" the insensibility being as profound while
it lasts as in the coma of narcotic poisoning or
pressure on the brain; but coming on and passing
off with such suddenness as to shew that
it is dependent upon some transient condition
of the sensorium, which, with our present
knowledge, we can pretty certainly assign to a
reduction in the supply of blood caused by a
sort of spasmodic contraction of the blood-vessels.'
This explanation, on a physiological basis, considerably
reduces the mystic character of those
mesmeric marvels in which the late Dr Elliotson
indulged at his public séances in Conduit Street.
It does not, however, as we imagine, detract from
the medical value that may be attached to the
calming of the nervous system by what is spoken
of as mesmeric sleep. Mr Braid, a practising
surgeon in Manchester, ingeniously fell on the
device of producing a profound mesmeric slumber
by simply causing individuals to fix their gaze determinedly
at a cork stuck at the top of their nose.
It was not surprising that people should have been
lulled by being subjected to this species of Hypnotism.
Ordinary sleep may in most instances be
induced by keeping the lower extremities perfectly
still, and determinedly fixing attention on the act
of breathing through the nostrils. Speaking from
experience, we offer this as a hint to the habitually
sleepless.</p>

<p>In the amusing book before us, the author shews
how clairvoyants have imposed on public assemblies
by tricks, which could be seen through by
sceptical observers. Miss Martineau, as is well
known, had a profound belief in the marvels of
mesmerism. This lady had a servant, J., to whom
was imputed wonderful powers of clairvoyance.
On one occasion, while in the mesmeric sleep, she
gave 'the particulars of the wreck of a vessel, of
which her cousin was one of the crew; as also of
the previous loss of a boy overboard; with which
particulars, it was positively affirmed by Miss
Martineau, and believed by many on her authority,
that the girl could not have been previously
informed, as her aunt had only brought the account
to the house when the séance was nearly terminated.
On being asked, says Miss M., two evenings
afterwards, when again in sleep, "whether she
knew what she related by hearing her aunt telling
the people below," J. replied: "No; I saw the place
and the people themselves&mdash;like a vision." And
Miss Martineau believed her.' After all, the girl
was proved to be an impostor. A medical friend,
on making a rigorous investigation, discovered
'unequivocally that J.'s aunt had told the whole
story to her sister, in whose house Miss M. was
residing, about <i>three hours before the séance</i>; and
that though J. was not then in the room, the circumstances
were fully discussed in her presence
before she was summoned to the mesmeric performance.
Thus not only was J. completely discredited
as a seer, but the value of <i>all</i> testimony
to such marvels was seriously lowered, when so
intelligent a witness as Harriet Martineau could
be so completely led astray by her prepossessions
as to put forth statements as facts, which were at
once upset by the careful inquiry which she ought
to have made before committing herself to them.'</p>

<p>A preconceived determination or proneness to
believe in the reality of any seeming marvel
without any other evidence than the senses, goes
a great way to explain the stories that are fondly
cherished by the dupes of spiritualism. The error
lies in taking things for granted. At one time
people were all agog as to the wonders of table-turning,
and it is amusing to remember how the
wonder was speedily exploded by the appliances
suggested by Faraday. He conclusively shewed
that the operators, however honest, unconsciously
exerted a muscular action, causing the table to
turn in the direction previously conceived. The
whole thing was a curious piece of self-deception.
Dupes of spiritualistic manipulators are similarly
self-deceived. They go to séances in the fond hope
of seeing incomprehensible marvels by 'mediums'
and table-rappers, and come away believing that
all has been real, instead of being only tricks
worthy or unworthy of a conjurer. Certainly, at
no séance of spiritualists have the performances
excelled the wonders effected by those adepts in
conjuring, Maskelyne and Cooke.</p>

<p>Although exploded and discredited, table-turning
has latterly come up in the new form of
planchette, a fashionable toy alleged to be endowed
with singularly mystic qualities. Consisting of a
small and easily moved board, in which a pencil
is stuck with the point downwards on paper or
slate laid on a table, the machine is said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">{483}</a></span>
capable of answering questions put to the operator
who presses on the board with his hands. No
doubt, the pencil will write answers as required,
but it does so only by the conscious or unconscious
muscular action of the hands on the board. This
weak device of pretending to get answers to questions
by the agency of an inanimate piece of wood
and a pencil, has been resorted to by real or sham
believers in spiritualism; and we are presented
with the melancholy spectacle of decent-looking
ladies and gentlemen sitting gravely round a table
affecting to hold a conversation with beings in the
unseen world.</p>

<p>Just as mesmerism lost its reputation as a branch
of psychology, so has spiritualism begun to be
estimated at its true value. It was always very
much against it, that its professors held their
séances in darkened apartments, and that for the
most part they took money for the display of their
wonders. The thing became a trade, and so it
would have continued but for the prosecution
and conviction of persons who stood guilty of imposture,
and of taking money under false pretences.
To add to the discomfiture of trading spiritualists,
their tricks have been exposed in the book, <i>Lights
and Shadows of Spiritualism</i>, by D. D. Home, who,
however, lets it be known that he is among the
few genuine professors of the art whose operations
are alleged to be beyond suspicion! As shewn by
Dr Carpenter, deception is not confined to those
who practise for gain. He speaks of young ladies
who take pleasure in imposing on elderly persons
by tricks of an ingenious kind. 'I could tell,'
says he, 'the particulars, in my possession, of the
detection of the imposture practised by one of the
most noteworthy of these lady-mediums, in the
distribution of flowers which she averred to be
brought in by the "spirits" in a dark séance,
fresh from the garden and wet with the dew of
heaven; these flowers having really been previously
collected in a basin up-stairs, and watered
out of a decanter standing by&mdash;as was proved by
the fact, that an inquisitive sceptic having furtively
introduced into the water of the decanter a small
quantity of a nearly colourless salt (ferrocyanide
of potassium), its presence in the dew of the
flowers was afterwards recognised by the appropriate
chemical test (a per-salt of iron), which
brought out "Prussian-blue."'</p>

<p>Other instances are presented of deceptions
practised in private séances; but for these and much
that illustrates the whole tenor of the delusion,
we must refer to the work itself. We restrict
ourselves to quoting only one, but a very pertinent
remark: 'It is affirmed, such exposures <i>prove</i>
nothing against the genuineness of any new manifestation.
But I affirm that to any one accustomed
to weigh the value of evidence, the fact that the
testimony in favour of a whole series of antecedent
claims has been completely upset, seriously invalidates
(as I have shewn in regard to mesmeric
<i>clairvoyance</i>) the trustworthiness of the testimony
in favour of any new claimant to "occult" powers.
Why should I believe the testimony of any believer
in the genuineness of D's performances, when he
has been obliged to admit that he has been egregiously
deceived in the cases of A, B, and C?'</p>

<p>For this instructive and admirably written work,
offering a lucid philosophical explanation of the
source of Predominant Delusions, which are apt to
be turned to a bad account by the designing, and
are in every sense mischievous, as conveying erroneous
notions of natural phenomena, the learned
author deserves the hearty thanks of the community.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS" id="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS">THE LAST OF THE HADDONS.</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>CHAPTER XXXV.&mdash;A TWELVEMONTH AFTER.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A glorious</span> morning in early August. I was
standing in a large cheerful room, from the windows
of which was an extensive view of beautiful
country, hill and dale, clothed with the rich ripe
fullness of fruit-time, while to ear was borne 'the
distant cries of reapers in the corn&mdash;all the live
murmur of a summer day.'</p>

<p>I was attiring myself&mdash;or I ought rather to say
being attired&mdash;for a wedding, attended right royally,
no less than twenty handmaidens hovering about
me, each eager to do something towards my adornment;
and each as desirous that I should look
my very best as I was myself, which is saying a
great deal. Never was slave of fashion more
anxious to make an effective appearance than was
I on this bright August morning. But even I
began to be satisfied as the process of adornment
went on, and I was gradually transformed from
a sober brown chrysalis into a brilliant butterfly.
A bright blue silk dress, an elegant lace cloak,
white bonnet with blush roses, &amp;c. &amp;c. Everything,
be it understood, of the very best that money
could buy, and made in the latest mode, there not
being a sombre colour or faded shred about me.
'All new and fresh and bright, as befits a butterfly!'
I ejaculated, contemplating myself with a
glad smile.</p>

<p>And then there was the one thing&mdash;ah, I knew it
now; my prayers <i>had</i> been answered! Even
allowing for the flush of excitement, this was not
the face of a twelvemonth ago smiling gaily back
at me from the dressing-glass. The eyes had lost
their mournfulness, the mouth had become used
to smile, and the whole face was full of life and
colour. 'Yes; it all matches beautifully,' I acknowledged,
in smiling assent to the exclamations
of my attendants. 'But I require care, you know,'
as they all pressed about me; 'not a rose must
be crushed. And it is to be hoped that I shall
not forget that I wear a train, and spoil the effect
by falling over it;' which raised a laugh amongst
my handmaidens, as royal wit should. Then being
pronounced 'finished,' I went out into the gallery,
and descended the broad staircase (my home was
one of the finest old mansions in Kent) with my
train about me. In the long room I was met by
Jane Osborne, who, after examining me very critically
from head to foot, was graciously pleased to
add her testimony to that of the rest, and pronounce
that I should do. I was nevertheless
obliged to call her to order in a little aside for
a certain trembling of the voice and moisture in
the eyes&mdash;a weakness not to be looked over in
Jane Osborne.</p>

<p>'God bless you, Mary! By five o'clock, remember.'</p>

<p>I just touched her lips, since she would have it
so, notwithstanding my pointing it out to her that
it was not a time for sentiment; and then with
her hand in mine and attended by my train, I
went into the court-yard, where my carriage awaited
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">{484}</a></span></p>

<p>'It couldn't have been grander if it had been
created out of a pumpkin!' I whispered to Jane.</p>

<p>She looked uneasily at me. 'Do not try to
jest, Mary,' she replied anxiously.</p>

<p>'Why not? if I feel equal to it, you foolish
person!'</p>

<p>'<i>Are</i> you equal to it, Mary?'</p>

<p>'<i>Quite.</i> If I had doubted it before, I knew
when I saw myself in the glass this morning.
You ought to be able to see the difference.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she murmured, 'there is a difference.&mdash;You
will find the flowers in the carriage, Mary.'</p>

<p>I stepped in, and was swiftly borne away,
amidst&mdash;I had almost written a flourish of
trumpets, so very loud and shrill were some
of the voices shouting all sorts of good wishes
after me.</p>

<p>I flattered myself that the effect was very telling
indeed, when my equipage, with its spirited horses
and coachman and footman wearing large breastplates
of flowers, drew up before the porch of the
pretty little ivy-covered vale church. I was
received by the beadle and pew-opener with due
respect, and found that I was in very good time.
The gentlemen and some of the guests were
already in the vestry, said the pew-opener; and
in the porch were waiting two pretty young
bride's-maids, who eyed me rather curiously.
They had just time to remind me that my place
was with the guests inside the church, and I to
reply that I preferred waiting there, when a
carriage of much more modest pretensions than
mine drew up, and the two I waited for stepped
out.</p>

<p>'Mary, Mary!' ejaculated Lilian, springing towards
me with outstretched arms, forgetful, as I
even then had the nerve to remind her, of our
finery. What would become of me if I gave
way now? 'Mary, Mary!'</p>

<p>And no sooner had I released myself from
Lilian than there was my dear old Mrs Tipper
giving me a good honest hug, utterly regardless
of appearances. And as to finery! she had long
ceased to allow that to interfere with her love, and
was not to be daunted by any such consideration
now.</p>

<p>The little bride's-maids, who were very carefully
guarding their laces and muslins, reserving
themselves for the right moment, looked with
much disfavour at an ebullition of feeling at
the wrong point in the ceremony; and now
reminded us that it was half-past eleven, and
that the clergyman and the other guests had been
waiting some time. At which, with a meaning
look at me, Mrs Tipper put Lilian's hand into
mine, and we two passed up the aisle together,
whilst the dear little woman walked after us with
the bride's-maids, notwithstanding their whispered
protestations that it was 'wrong&mdash;altogether wrong&mdash;and
the effect was <i>quite</i> spoiled!'</p>

<p>As Philip turned to meet us, I put his bride's
hand into his with a smile which appeared to
satisfy even him. Moreover, Robert Wentworth's
face brightened, and Robert Wentworth's critical
observance had been anticipated with some little
anxiety.</p>

<p>Lilian's uncle, the father of the bride's-maids,
was to 'give her away;' he looked not a little
curiously at the person whose appearance seemed
to cause so much sensation; but his curiosity did
not affect me.</p>

<p>At the words, 'Who giveth this woman to be
married to this man?' Major Maitland gave the
necessary response; but both bride and bridegroom
turned their eyes upon me, as though the
gift were mine.</p>

<p>As soon as the ceremony was over, Philip
and Lilian turned towards me; and for a few
moments we three gave no thought to the <i>convenances</i>,
as we clasped hands and murmured a
few words meant only for each other. Then the
rest of the party gathered about the bride and
bridegroom, and I became conscious of the presence
of others that were known to me: Philip's brother
Mr Dallas, and his wife, and Mrs Trafford and
her sister-in-law Mrs Chichester. Marian Trafford
was gorgeously attired in what no doubt was the
latest Paris fashion; although I think that even
she was conscious that her splendour did not
eclipse mine. They had not evidently expected
to see me there, and both, I felt, watched very
curiously for any slight giving-way upon my part.
But if I could calmly meet Philip's eyes, it may
be imagined that I was proof against the scrutiny
of either Marian Trafford or her sister-in-law. And
Mrs Chichester's softly spoken little aside: 'Did
not I think that the bride and bridegroom were an
admirably matched couple, even to age&mdash;eighteen
and thirty was just as it should be; was it not?'
was assented to with a cheerfulness which did not
seem to gratify her as a looker-on might have
expected it to do.</p>

<p>There was only one shadow on the bride's lovely
face, and that came when she signed her name;
and perhaps it was natural enough that Major
Maitland should frown at the remembrance of the
wrong done to his sister. But it was the last time
Lilian would be so pained, and she was not
allowed time to dwell upon it now.</p>

<p>When we stood aside for her and Philip to pass
out, she caught my hand and drew me with them,
and in that very unorthodox fashion we left the
church and entered the carriage&mdash;'Mary's carriage,'
as Lilian termed it. There not being room enough
at the cottage, the breakfast was to take place at
Hill Side, and we were driven there&mdash;so far as a
carriage could convey us&mdash;for we had to alight at
the foot of the hill and walk the remainder of the
distance.</p>

<p>As soon as we reached the plantations, Lilian
took my face between her hands and gazed at me
with anxious tender eyes. Then, with a deep-drawn
sigh of relief and a radiant smile she murmured:
'It was true, Philip; she <i>is</i> happy!'</p>

<p>'Yes; thank God!' he ejaculated.</p>

<p>I made it the occasion for a little jest about my
truth having been doubted; and by that time
some of the others had come up with us, when the
bride naturally absorbed all the attention, and the
rest was easy. It was the first wedding-breakfast
at which I had been a guest, and therefore I was
not <i>au fait</i> in such matters. I can only say that if
there were any little divergences from the etiquette
proper upon such occasions, they were unobserved
by me. I knew that the two I most cared for
in the world were made happy, and that all the
rest of us were pleasant with each other, as befitted
wedding-guests. I was afterwards told that the
bride's-maids thought that they had not been sufficiently
considered in being only provided with one
gentleman, and he so grave a one as Robert Wentworth.
And Philip's brother and his wife were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">{485}</a></span>
said to be very stiff with us all; whilst Major
Maitland was more anxious than it was polite to
be to catch an early return train, reminding his
daughters that <i>they</i> must not be the cause of his
losing it, and so forth. But I looked through rose-coloured
spectacles, and it seemed all flowers and
sunshine to me.</p>

<p>Dear old Mrs Tipper and I sat together; and it
did me not a little good to feel the eloquent
pressure of her hand, which she now and again
slipped into mine as the breakfast went on. I am,
to this day, not quite sure how much Mrs Tipper
knew of the truth; but I saw that she at anyrate
guessed something of it, when, in a tremulous
voice, she whispered a few words about my having
given happiness to her child.</p>

<p>I tried a little jest about still having enough and
to spare.</p>

<p>'Yes, my dear; that is the best of it; you really
are happy. Thank God, you are reaping'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I hurriedly commenced asking questions about
Becky, who, as I had so much hoped she would,
was about to become the wife of Tom. He was
engaged for the garden at Hill Side, and it was
arranged that he should live with his wife at the
cottage. Mrs Tipper elected to continue her
cottage life; and as she had become very much
attached to Becky, she was very glad to adopt my
suggestion, that the married couple should live
with her.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that I was ignorant of
anything which had transpired during my absence.
I had regularly corresponded with Lilian, although
I held firm to my first resolution, not to return
amongst them again until Philip and she were
married, and so brought about the event at an
earlier date than it might otherwise have taken
place. I need not say that Becky proved a firm
ally, and faithfully kept my secret. Faithful
Becky! how difficult it was for some time to get her
to talk about her happiness to me! This first day
of my reappearance, I inquired in vain for Becky;
she was not to be found. I only caught sight of
her once when I was leaving Hill Side, watching
me from the back staircase, her eyes and nose
bearing eloquent witness to violent emotion; but
when I turned to speak to her, she sped away as
fast as her feet would carry her.</p>

<p>As soon as might be, the bride slipped away
with Mrs Tipper and me, to the increased disapprobation
of the bride's-maids, who prided themselves
upon being acquainted with all the proprieties
for such occasions. But it was not to be
expected that we could allow two comparative
strangers to act as tire-women to our Lilian; and
we carried her off, regardless of the murmurs about
its being 'all wrong&mdash;quite wrong!' and so forth.</p>

<p>Once alone together, we three behaved&mdash;well, I
will say as any other three women who love each
other and are not above having feelings might be
expected to behave under such circumstances. I
contrived to satisfy Lilian, as I had satisfied her
aunt, that I was no unhappy martyr, as she asked
me question after question, eyeing me with wistful
loving eyes.</p>

<p>'And you will not desert us again, Mary?'</p>

<p>'No; I will not desert you again, Lilian.'</p>

<p>'It is quite delightful to see her like this&mdash;quite
a grand personage, with a fine carriage and
livery servants and all the rest of it; isn't it, auntie?
I may now confess, Mary, that I have been the
least bit afraid that your talking about living in
a grand old house with a number of attendants to
do your bidding, was'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Was what, goosy?'</p>

<p>'Too much like a fairy tale; and you know you
used to talk like that sometimes, when you&mdash;when
I have fancied that you were not quite happy.'</p>

<p>'Are you satisfied at last, dearie?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I am&mdash;yes, quite. You look really happy.'
I mentally offered up a thanksgiving, as she went
on: 'But of course I am longing to know how it
all came about. Recollect, you have promised to
explain everything very exactly in your first letter.
Recollect too that I leave dear auntie to your care;
and of course we shall expect to find our sister
here on our return.'</p>

<p>I promised; and when we presently conducted
the bride in her travelling-dress to the drawing-room,
she was looking happy enough to satisfy
Philip, who, I noticed, glanced anxiously from me
to her as we entered.</p>

<p>We all went down the winding path with them
to the carriage waiting in the road below; and
sent them off with all sorts of merry speeches and
good wishes and the orthodox accompaniment of
old slippers.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAND_OF_THE_PHARAOHS" id="THE_LAND_OF_THE_PHARAOHS">THE LAND OF THE PHARAOHS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> past lends to Egypt a charm more entrancing
than its cloudless skies and delicious climate. Go
where you will, antiquity meets you at every turn.
Around you lie the ruins of cities whose very
names have been obliterated in the silent march of
the ages. Before you flows the sacred river upon
whose waves floated centuries ago the little ark of
the outcast Hebrew infant, and the golden barge of
the gorgeous daughter of the Ptolemies. Time
was when this old Nile was the highway down
which many successive nations rushed to conquest:
for the Ethiopian, the Assyrian, the Persian, the
Roman, and the Saracen have all lorded it in turn
in this ancient realm of the Pharaohs. Now
vexed no longer with the fleets of rival monarchs,
the mighty river rocks with slumberous swell the
lotus lilies on its tranquil breast; and on its lonely
banks, which have rung so often in days gone by
to the shrill pæans of triumph, the palms in the
sultry noontide throw their long shadows athwart
ruined temples and colossal statues, grand in
execution and faultless in detail, which reveal in
every outline the perfection to which the arts of
architecture and sculpture were carried in this
their earliest cradle. The soil is strewed with
fragments of broken columns and defaced colossi.
Buried beneath the drifting sand of the Desert lie
the glorious and yet grotesque masterpieces of the
Egyptian chisel. Serene, grave, majestic, inundated
with a flood of harmonious light, the calm
features of the once inscrutable Sphinx look down
upon us, as many centuries ago they looked down
in their grand repose upon the wondering Father of
History. Time has pressed lightly on these Titanic
temples and vast tomb palaces, but from their
shadowy portals the worshippers have gone for
ever. Desolate and state-fallen, they open now
only to admit the curious stranger.</p>

<p>In <i>A Thousand Miles up the Nile</i>, by Miss
Edwards, we have a lively gossiping description
of the Egypt of to-day with its wasted temples and
ruined palaces. Cairo&mdash;where Miss Edwards tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">{486}</a></span>
us she arrived in the end of November 1873, with
a party of friends in pursuit of dry weather&mdash;is
a picturesque city. Seen from a distance
embowered in gardens of the richest green, it
looks like a forest of minarets and domes intermingled
with palm-trees and acacia groves. The
streets, as is always the case in eastern cities, are
narrow and intricate; but their gloom is enlivened
by a series of gorgeous bazaars, where the little
pigeon-holes of shops are bright with many-hued
carpets, and gay with delicately tinted silks, and
glittering tissues of gold and silver. Here you can
buy precious stones of varied value, and bracelets
and collars of intricate and complex designs, such
as were the fashion thousands of years ago at the
court of the Pharaohs; or invest, if you choose, in
a variety of warlike weapons, inlaid with gold and
silver, and damascened with exquisite arabesque
patterns.</p>

<p>The busy crowd passing and repassing the
while, presents to the stranger a series of intensely
interesting <i>tableaux vivants</i>. There, with ample
turban and flowing beard and long robes of striped
silk, stalks the stately Turk, followed by a scantily
clad Fellahin. Next comes some Light of the
Harem, some Fatima or Emineh, mounted on a
carefully painted donkey led by an armed slave.
On the street this fair enchantress is but a shroud-like
mass of drapery, through which the curious
gazer can sometimes discern the outline of a
delicately oval face and the flash of a black liquid
eye. Behind her, in thin clinging robes of dark
but vivid blue, with graceful form and carelessly
veiled melancholy face, a Niobe in bronze,
glides an Abyssinian slave-girl. By her side a
swarthy Bedouin sheik reins in an Arab steed,
whose prancings and curvetings somewhat disturb
the gravity of the tiny donkey upon which that
Englishman is mounted; while over all streams
the sunshine of an Egyptian noon, flooding
with light the unfamiliar draperies, the strange
Saracenic architecture, and the varying features
and costumes of each commingling race.</p>

<p>While conducting the important operation of
bargaining for a dahabeeyah (a Nile-boat), Miss
Edwards and her party went to interview the
Great Pyramid. She had fancied that the Pyramids
looked small and unimpressive when she first
caught a glimpse of them from the railway carriage;
but once at the base of this gigantic tomb, she
realised, with a sense of awe and wonder, how
mighty it was. As she lingered, loath to leave the
scene, the sun set in crimson glory behind the sands
of the Libyan Desert, and the shadow flung by this
immense mass of masonry stretched full three-quarters
of a mile over the plain below. 'It was,'
she says, 'with a thrill of something like awe that
I remembered that this self-same shadow had gone
on registering not only the height of the most
stupendous gnomon ever set up by human hands,
but the slow passage, day by day, of more than
sixty centuries of the world's history.'</p>

<p>Before starting up the Nile, Miss Edwards witnessed
two of the characteristic sights of Cairo&mdash;a
performance of howling dervishes, and the departure
of a caravan of pilgrims for Mecca. She
found the convent of the howling dervishes situated
in a picturesque nook beyond the walls.
The gateway and courtyard beyond were shaded
by a great sycamore tree, through whose branches
the glowing sunshine broke in vivid flecks and
bars of gold. About seventy dervishes were present;
and with the aid of eight musicians, and to the
chant of 'Allah! Allah!' they danced round in a
circle until they had worked themselves up into
a state of convulsive frenzy. Gradually their
dance became a series of mad leaps, performed
with incredible rapidity, their chant swelled into
a hoarse scream, and at last one of the devotees
fell writhing and shrieking to the ground. This
ended the first performance; and the English ladies
did not wait for a second.</p>

<p>Having made choice of a dahabeeyah yclept the
<i>Philæ</i>, Miss Edwards and her party started with
a fair breeze for their voyage up the Nile. This
once sacred historic river is, as every one knows,
all in all to the Egyptian. His harvests depend
upon its beneficent inundations, its waves form his
highway to the sea, he eats of its fish, he drinks
of its waters, and finds them still, as his ancestors
found them of old, delicious as the nectar of the
gods. Egypt, baked and shrivelled by the glowing
sun into one immense brick, annually sinks
beneath the waters of the life-giving river, and
emerges from the flood, fresh, radiant, shining,
like an emerald, flower-crowned like Ceres of old,
and holding in her full hands an ample promise
of fruit and sheaf. A Nile voyage in favourable
weather is about the pleasantest of all pleasant
things. The large sails of the dahabeeyah swell
out to the breeze like the wide snowy wings of a
sea-bird, and fleet as that bird, she cleaves her
way past water-palaces and suburban gardens.
The minarets and domes of Cairo are left behind;
the Pyramids, towering over the groves of palm,
stand clearly out against the cloudless sky; and
the distant ridges of the Arabian hills glow with
softened shades of tawny purple. As evening falls,
every charm of the landscape is subdued into a
more tender repose; the night-breeze balmy and
cool sweeps up the river; darkness follows, and
your boat is moored for the night at Bedreshayn.</p>

<p>Morning on the Nile is inexpressibly fresh and
beautiful. At the first faint streak of dawn the
light mist clears away, and Aurora spreads for the
sun a rosy chariot of clouds, into which he steps
at once, flushing the stately palm-groves, and the
gleaming river, and the picturesque water-wheels,
and the swarthy crew, with a flood of golden
radiance. There was, however, little time for
sentimental feeling, our author's whole attention
being claimed by a horrible clamour which arose
outside, caused by the arrival of a regiment of
donkeys attended by a phalanx of men and boys.</p>

<p>Mounted upon eight of these asinine martyrs,
Miss Edwards and her party proceeded to Sakkarah
and Memphis, riding through a country
which would have been monotonous but for the
subtle beauty of its colouring. Tender tints of
rose, and warm tones of russet gold, pale opalescent
blues and grays and dusky purples, were
all blended by Nature's cunning brush, shading
into the nearer green of the dusky palm forests,
until they formed one inimitable whole. Sakkarah
is a vast necropolis, whose more distinguished
tombs are pyramids. The soil around is
full of fragments of broken pottery, mummy gods,
bones, shreds of linen, and lumps of a strange
brown substance like dried sponge. Tread lightly,
O Northern stranger! around you are the mighty
dead; that brown spongy mass was once warm
human flesh, instinct with power and passion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">{487}</a></span>
that skull perchance once held the scheming brain
of a Pharaoh, who reared for himself one of these
vast sepulchres, little dreaming of this all too
ignoble resurrection. Of Memphis, the ancient city
of the Egyptian kings, only a few mounds remain
embowered in vast palm-forests, through whose
fan-like foliage the brilliant sunshine falls aslant
upon a muddy pool, where, face downwards, lies
the far-famed Colossus of Rameses the Great,
which, like Cleopatra's Needle, belongs to the
British nation. This, with a few battered sphinxes,
is all that is left of one of the earliest cities of the
world.</p>

<p>On their way to Minieh, a Moslem saint of peculiar
sanctity, yclept holy St Cotton, swam out to
them, and having hallowed by a touch the tiller-ropes
and yards of the <i>Philæ</i>, dropped into the
water again, and swam back to the shore. It
happened to be market-day when they arrived at
Minieh, and having stores to buy, they proceeded
to it, and found almost everything exceedingly
cheap. How it would rejoice the heart of a thrifty
housewife here at home to be able to buy a
hundred eggs for fourteenpence, or a couple of
chickens for tenpence, not to speak of fine geese at
two shillings a head! Large and very good turkeys
may be bought for three-and-sixpence, a lamb for
seven shillings, and a sheep for sixteen shillings or
a pound, fruit and vegetables being proportionably
moderate.</p>

<p>In Egypt, little children have very hard lines of
it. It makes one's heart ache to read of the disease
and suffering induced by the barbarous ignorance
of their parents. Miss Edwards says: 'To brush
away the flies that beset the eyes of young children
is impious; hence ophthalmia and various kinds
of blindness. I have seen infants lying in their
mother's arms with six or eight flies in each eye;
I have seen the little helpless hands put down
reprovingly if they approached the seat of annoyance.
I have seen children of four or five years
old with the surface of one or both eyes eaten
away, and others with a large fleshy lump growing
out where the pupil had been destroyed.'</p>

<p>As a consequence of this horrible cruelty three
children out of every five die in Egypt; and in
certain districts every twentieth person is either
wholly or partially blind.</p>

<p>On Christmas-day Miss Edwards entertained
some friends, who were in a dahabeeyah behind
them, to dinner. The guests consisted of a bride
and bridegroom and a painter. The scene around
their floating dining-room was lovely; the placid
river flowed tranquilly through broad green savannahs,
and breezes redolent of perfume fanned the
lotus lilies beneath their prow. It required all
the conventional sentiment which attaches to a
blazing plum-pudding to convince them that it
was really Christmas.</p>

<p>At Siout, the capital of Middle Egypt, they
inspected the celebrated Stabl d'Antar. It is
a splendid tomb temple hewn out of the
rock. The roofs of its lofty chambers are painted
in fresh and vivid colours, and the walls are
covered with bas-reliefs and hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>En route to Denderah, at a part of the river
where the banks were flat and bare, they saw on
the western shore what seemed to be a large
grizzled ape perched upon a dust-heap, and
learned with intense surprise that it was Sheik
Seleem, a sort of Moslem St Simon Stylites.
There he sat in the gathering night, as he had
sat for fifty years from darkness to dawn, and from
dawn to darkness, amid inconceivable filth and
squalor, not even moving to feed himself. The
sailors shouted to him as they passed, loudly
imploring his blessing; but he made no sign of
response. Motionless as a huge frog, he squatted
on his dust-throne, inflated with spiritual pride or
madness, or both.</p>

<p>About ten miles below Denderah thousands of
Fellahin were at enforced work on the embankment
of a new canal. These canals are the life
of Egypt; by them the supply of the precious
water is regulated and its outlay economised.
Without canals and the ever-recurring water-wheels,
the fresh green beauty of the river-plains
would soon disappear, and famine, gaunt
and hollow-eyed, stalk upon the scene, with
disease and death in its train.</p>

<p>At Denderah, among other interesting remains,
they found a splendid temple in an almost perfect
condition, with a finely executed bas-relief of
Cleopatra. This queen of beauty, whose slaves
were the masters of the world, is fair enough in
this mask of stone to recall to Miss Edwards something
of that loveliness which conquered Cæsar.
'Mannerism apart,' she says, 'the face wants for
neither individuality nor beauty. Cover the
mouth, and you have an almost faultless profile.
The chin and throat are also quite lovely; while
the whole face, suggestive of cruelty, subtlety, and
voluptuousness, carries with it an indefinable expression,
not only of portraiture but of likeness.'</p>

<p>On the third day after leaving Denderah, they
saw in the faint light of the early morning the
gigantic propylons of Karnak towering vast and
gray against the horizon. The warm flush of the
dawn bathed with rosy light the range of precipitous
hills, which are honeycombed with the
tombs of the kings, and kissed into tender beauty
the time-worn columns of Luxor, the ancient
Woolwich of the Pharaohs. At Karnak, the ruins
are stupendous; the eye loses itself in a waste of
giant propylons, columns towering to the clouds,
colossal figures in black granite, partially buried in
the sand; and a little apart, in solitary grandeur, an
immense obelisk, seventy-five feet high, covered
with hieroglyphics and bas-reliefs, depicting scenes
in the life of Rameses the Great. In the temple at
Karnak, the great hall of pillars, roofless and vast,
presents to the eye of the curious gazer forests of
colonnades, aisles of pillars, huge pylons, towering
like giants to the sky, half-hiding, half-revealing
weird fantastic bas-reliefs of the gods, who glare,
superb in ruin, over their desolated shrines. The
sunlight streaming through the open portal shines
on avenues of sphinxes, battered colossi, vast lengths
of splendid bas-reliefs, glowing with a depth and
freshness of colour which Time has had no power
to fade; labyrinths of headless statues, prostrate
obelisks, shattered images, all in such numbers
that they produce a bewildering effect upon the
mind.</p>

<p>At Esneh, their next halting-place, there was
also a very beautiful temple, dedicated to Kneph.
Assouan and Elephantiné (the Isle of Flowers) came
next. At Assouan, Egypt proper ceases, and Nubia
begins. Here the traveller enters upon the region
of the Cataracts, a succession of rapids extending
almost all the way to Philæ. The Nile at this point
is singularly picturesque. First narrowed between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">{488}</a></span>
banks of dark red cliffs, it suddenly expands
almost to the breadth of a lake, and presents a
broad expanse bristling with rocks and covered
with innumerable islets, round which the water
rushes in swirling eddies of foam. The navigation
among these islets is difficult and dangerous; the
boat half buried in spray, struggles gallantly forward,
making a succession of rapid rushes, as if
she were about to dive headlong over the fall; but
it is too much for her; she recoils, quivers, turns
round, and seems to be driving right upon a huge
mass of black granite, when the Sheik of the Cataracts
comes to her aid. This tutelary genius of the
Nile dahabeeyahs has few of the external attributes
of a hero. He is a little fat ugly man; but
what of that? he knows his work, and can do it.
A moment more, and the dahabeeyah and its
inmates will be ingulfed in the foaming abyss; but
before that moment comes, he springs up, plunges
into the torrent, pushes off the boat by sheer force
of muscle; and then he and his tawny assistants
drag her up the rapid.</p>

<p>It is a lengthy operation; and while it was
in progress, Miss Edwards and her party made a
pilgrimage to Philæ. Beautiful Philæ, the fabled
tomb of Osiris, the Holy Island whose very
soil was sacred, still preserves almost uninjured
the beautiful temples and gorgeous tomb-palaces
which were the master-pieces of the later style of
Egyptian art. The vastness, the gigantic proportions
of Thebes and Karnak, are not aimed at here;
on the contrary, there is an inimitable grace, an
airy lightness about cloister and colonnade, which
are half Greek. And what Art has so nobly
accomplished, Nature has not been slow to assist.
The cloudless sky, the graceful palms, the majestic
carob trees, enwrap with greenness and beauty all
the wealth of colouring, of sculpture, and of architecture
which the past has bequeathed to this
spot, once so hallowed, now so lonely. Lingering
tenderly reminiscent on the pearly strand of this
voluptuous Egyptian Iona, one half expects to see
the white-robed priests of Isis wind again in long
procession out of the shadow into the sunshine,
solemn and stern, vainly questioning of the forgotten
ages&mdash;What meaneth this?</p>

<p>Leaving Philæ, ever lessening in the distance,
the travellers glide away into Nubia, and are
quickly conscious of a perceptible change, first in
the river scenery, which becomes wilder and more
grand, and then in the character of the inhabitants,
who become more savage, and at the same time
more truthful and honest. The climate becomes
warmer, and with the accession of heat, turbans
disappear, and the only headgear is that furnished
by Nature, consisting of profuse thickly matted
hair, plentifully anointed with castor-oil, a species
of pomade which frizzling in a tropical sun makes
a Nubian beau or belle an exceedingly savoury
individual. Very little clothing is worn; the
young of both sexes are content with a slight
covering round the waist, and the matrons with a
single long loose garment of blue. The Nubian
women are often beautiful, with lustrous gentle
eyes, and grand majestic figures like Junos in
bronze. If their wardrobes are slender, their
jewel caskets seem well supplied, for they almost
invariably wear a profusion of gold and silver
ornaments.</p>

<p>Nubia, like Egypt, abounds in temples. At
Aboo-Simbel there are two excavated out of the
sandstone rock. On the façade of the great
temple there is a wonderful row of colossal figures,
portraits of Rameses the Great and some of his
more immediate successors. This Rameses is believed
with good reason to have been the Pharaoh who
oppressed the Israelites. Many hieroglyphic records
of his reign have been discovered, some of which
when deciphered run thus: 'I, the scribe, have
obeyed the orders of my master, and served out
rations to the Hebrews, who quarry stone for the
palaces of King Rameses, Mer Ammon.' This
monarch, whose passion it was to build, has left
a more ineradicable impress of his personality
upon the scenes of his former glory, than any of
his predecessors or successors have done. His face,
preserved for us by an Aboo-Simbel Michael
Angelo, still frowns in lonely majesty across the
desert sands, handsome, placid, sternly implacable,
precisely the man who would account the tears
and anguish of helpless thousands as less than
nothing when weighed against a pet project.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving Aboo-Simbel, Miss Edwards
had a pleasure which she had almost despaired of&mdash;she
saw a crocodile. The creature was asleep upon
a sandbank, and was to all appearance so exactly
like a log of drift-wood, that our author refused
to believe it was a veritable crocodile until, aroused
by the approach of the dahabeeyah, it cocked up
its tail, wriggled off the bank, and splashed into
the water with amazing rapidity.</p>

<p>They were now on their return journey, and the
wind was against them, necessitating frequent and
vexatious delays.</p>

<p>At a place called Ayserat they paid a visit to a
native gentleman, Ratab Agha, and before leaving
were conducted to his harem. He had two wives:
the principal wife was very beautiful, with auburn
hair, soft brown eyes, and lovely complexion; her
rival was plain; and both were magnificently
dressed in black robes embroidered with silver,
full pink Turkish trousers, and silver bracelets
and anklets. They wore their hair cut straight
across the brow and plaited behind into an infinitude
of small tails studded with coins.</p>

<p>A parting visit to the Pyramids followed; and
with an inspection of these colossal monuments,
which remain an imperishable testimony to the
vigour of the world's dawn, they bade adieu to
what was once the mighty temple-crowned empire
of Rameses the Great.</p>

<h2><a name="A_QUEER_CLUE" id="A_QUEER_CLUE">A QUEER CLUE.</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>IN TWO CHAPTERS.&mdash;CHAPTER I.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> an ex-detective, I am often asked to relate my
adventures, and at one time I was ready enough to
do so; but I soon found that my tales were looked
upon as dull prosy things, and not at all like what
detectives ought to have to say for themselves.
Everybody seemed to think that detectives ought
to find things out by a sort of magical divination;
but I was reckoned a pretty good one, and I have
known some of our greatest celebrities; and the
only way any of us ever found anything out was
by inquiring of everybody who was likely to know
a little, keeping our eyes on any probable party,
holding our tongues, and putting all the scraps
together. Now and then we are befriended by a
lucky chance; and when this happens, we get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">{489}</a></span>
hundred times more praise than when we puzzle
out the darkest and toughest case. The last affair
I was ever engaged in was of this kind. I was first
concerned in it two years before I left the police,
after, by-the-bye, I had quite given up the detective
branch; and I resumed it three years afterwards,
that is three years after I had left the police; and
this is how it occurred. I must first say, however,
that I don't at all regard this as one of the
dull prosy cases I referred to; in fact, it was the
most exciting business I was ever engaged in.</p>

<p>I had left the detective work, as I said, and
indeed had left London, for when I grew a little
tired of the business, I was recommended to the
authorities at Combestead, a thriving market-town
in one of the home counties; and I had a very
comfortable situation there, having little to do,
very good pay, and being head of the borough
police. Of course there is a great deal of difference
between life in the country and life in town,
and from a policeman's view it perhaps appears
greater than it does to anybody else; and whereas
I had often wondered how anybody could be
detected in London, I was equally surprised to
think how anybody could hope to escape in the
country; for, excepting when strangers came down
on some carefully planned burglary, we could
nearly always tell where to look for our men if
anything went wrong; in short, I knew everybody.
As a matter of course, everybody knew me.</p>

<p>There was a middle-aged party lived in a quiet
row of houses in Orchard Street&mdash;which ran parallel
with our High Street&mdash;a Miss Parkway, who
was reputed to be pretty well off, although not
extremely rich, and reputed also to be rather
eccentric. She lived by herself, in the sense of
having none of her relatives with her; but there
were other persons, although not many, in the
large house where she lodged. I had my attention
drawn to her by seeing her walking repeatedly in
company with a young man of no very good character,
who was fully twenty years her junior; and
at last I heard she was going to be married to him.
All the town professed to be surprised and shocked
at this, but I wasn't. Whether detectives get hard
of heart in such things or not, I can't say, but
nothing in the way of a woman of five-and-forty
marrying a man of five-and-twenty would ever
surprise me; nor should I be surprised at the man
marrying the woman if she had money, as in this
case. After all, although I have said John Lytherly&mdash;that
was his name&mdash;was of no very good character,
yet there was nothing serious against him.
He was a good-tempered, good-looking, easy sort
of fellow, with a lot of cleverness about him too,
that always shewed itself when it wasn't wanted;
and never shewed itself when it might be of service.
He now called himself a photographer; but
had been a solicitor's clerk, an actor, a traveller
for a wine-merchant, a barman, and had once,
before his mother died, been bought out of the
Lancers. However, it was now pretty well known
that John was going to marry Miss Parkway, and
half the young chaps in Combestead ridiculed and
envied him by turns.</p>

<p>Matters progressed so far that it was known the
lady had given orders to Bunnyman and Company,
our chief bankers, to call in a thousand pounds of
her money which was out on mortgage; and it was
said she intended to buy one of the houses in the
High Street and fit it up as a photographer's. It
was also reported that old Mr Bunnyman said: 'I
hope, Miss Parkway, that whatever you do with
your money, you will do nothing that you have
not well considered.' And it was also said that
Miss Parkway replied: 'If I wanted to be preached
to, Mr Bunnyman, I should go to your brother the
Ranter;'&mdash;perhaps because Mr Bunnyman had a
brother who preached, though he wasn't a Ranter
at all. However, as these two were by themselves,
I don't see how any one could have known what
passed; and these confidential conversations in
books and histories are certainly things I don't
believe in.</p>

<p>It was known for certain, however, that she had
not only given notice, but had actually withdrawn
the money; and among other things it was said
that she had admitted to her landlady Mrs
Ambliss, that the match with Lytherly would
break off all intimacy with her friends. She only
had one relative who came to see her, and that
was a gentleman living some forty miles away, but
he had not been to Combestead lately. Whether
he was offended or not, neither the landlady nor
lodger could say; but the latter feared he was, as
she had written and told him exactly how affairs
stood and what steps she had taken, but had
received no reply to her letter. Lytherly seemed,
very naturally, to be brightening up, and took
our jocular congratulations&mdash;for I had my say as
well as the others&mdash;in a good-tempered although
rather a conceited style. One annoyance he felt,
which was, that everybody to whom he owed
money&mdash;which was every one who would trust
him&mdash;was anxious to be the first paid; and thinking
that a little gentle pressure might help them,
two or three of the tradesmen took out county
court summonses against him; and this, as he
said, was very hard on him and very selfish.
However, there seemed a little chance that they
would defeat themselves, for, harassed and worried
by these doings, he was forced to ask Miss Parkway
for an advance of money, being the first time
he had ever done so. He had received money
from her; but she had always offered it, and
pressed it upon him when he made a show, if
he was not actually in earnest, of wishing to refuse
it. Whether she was in a bad temper at the time,
or whether she was hurt at his making such a
request, Lytherly could not say, but she refused
to make the advance, and they parted worse
friends than they had been for some time.</p>

<p>All this the young fellow let out at the <i>Bell</i>
on the Saturday, as the refusal happened on the
Friday. A great part of it in my hearing, for I
generally took my pipe and glass at the <i>Bell</i>, and
I saw that he was well on for tipsy. He had
indeed been drinking there some hours, and would
perhaps have stopped longer, but that the landlord
persuaded him to go home. He was hardly able
to walk, and as I did not wish him to get into
any trouble, which might mean also trouble to me,
I followed him to the door, determined I would
see him to his lodgings if necessary; but just then
his landlady's son happened to come by. The poor
chap, as I well remember, had been to the dentist's
to have a tooth drawn; but his face was so swollen
that Mr Clawes would not attempt to draw it till
daylight, and the poor fellow was half distracted
with pain. He offered to see Lytherly home;
and as he lived in the same house and slept in
the same room, of course he was the fittest party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">{490}</a></span>
to do so; and so off they went together, and in
due course of time I went home too.</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday, and a quiet day enough
it always was in Combestead. Younger men might
have thought it dull, but it suited me. I had lived
fifty years in London, and did not object to the
steady-going ways of the little town; in fact I
took to going to church, and all sorts of things.
Well, the day passed by without anything particular;
and I was really thinking of going to bed,
although it was only half-past nine, for I felt
sleepy and tired, when I heard somebody run
hurriedly up our front garden, and then followed
a very loud double-knock at the door. I lived, I
should mention, at a nice house in Church Street,
which was a turning that led from the High Street
into Orchard Street, where, as I have said, Miss
Parkway lived. I was just about to drink a glass
of egghot, which is a thing I am very partial to
when I have a cold, and this was winter-time;
but I put the tumbler down to listen, for when
such a hurried step and knock came, it was nearly
always for me; and sure enough, in another half-minute
the door was opened, and I heard a voice
ask if the superintendent was in; then without
any tapping or waiting, my door was thrown open,
and I saw a young woman, whom I knew as servant
to Mrs Ambliss. The moment I saw her, I
knew something serious was the matter; long experience
enabled me to decide when anything
really serious was coming.</p>

<p>'Now, Jane,' I said, 'what is it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Mr Robinson!' she exclaimed (I forget
whether I have mentioned before that my name is
Robinson, but such is the fact), 'come round at once
to missus's, for we have found poor Miss Parkway
stone-dead and murdered in her room.'</p>

<p>And with that, as is a matter of course with
such people, off she went into strong hysterics. I
couldn't stop with her; so I opened my door, and
equally, as a matter of course, there I found the
landlady and her servant listening. 'Go in and
take care of that girl,' I said; 'and one of you bring
her round to Orchard Street as soon as she can
walk.' I didn't stop to blow them up, and they
were too glad to escape, to say a word; so off I
went, and found a little cluster of people already
gathered round the gate of the house I wanted.
'Here is the superintendent!' I heard them say
as they made way for me. I hurried through, but
had no occasion to knock at the door, for they
were on the watch for me. Mr and Mrs Ambliss
were in the passage, and a neighbour from next
door; all looked as pale and flurried as people do
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>'This is a most terrible affair, sir,' says poor old
Ambliss, who was a feeble superannuated bank
clerk. 'We have sent for you, sir, and the doctor,
as being the best we could do. But perhaps you
would like to go into her room at once?'</p>

<p>I said I should, as a matter of course; and they
led me to her room. There was a light there, and
they brought more up, so that everything was
plainly visible. The people had not liked, or had
been afraid to disturb anything, so the room was
in the same state as when they had entered it. It
appeared they had not been surprised at Miss
Parkway not coming down in the morning, for
this was not uncommon with her; but when the
afternoon and evening passed away and she did
not appear, and no answer was returned to their
rapping at her door, they grew alarmed, and at last
forced an entrance, when they found the furniture
in confusion, as though a struggle had taken place,
and poor Miss Parkway in her night-dress lying
on her face quite dead. They had lifted her on
to the bed, and from the marks on her throat had
judged she died by strangulation. As I could do
no good to her, I noticed as closely as I was able
the appearance of the room, and especially looked
for any fragments of cloth torn from an assailant's
clothes, which often remain after a struggle; or
a dropped weapon, or any unusual marks. But I
could see nothing. There was no difficulty in
deciding how the assassin had entered the apartment,
and how he had left it, for the room was on
the ground-floor, and the lower sash of one of the
windows was thrown up, although the blind was
drawn fully down. The furniture was knocked
over and upset; the washstand, which was a large
and somewhat peculiar one, of a clumsy and old-fashioned
description, had been overthrown, and
had fallen into the fireplace, where it lay resting
on the bars in a very curious manner; while the
jug had fallen into the grate, deluging the fireplace
with water, but, extraordinary to relate,
without being broken; not broken to pieces at
anyrate, although badly cracked. A great deal of
noise had probably been made, and cries for help
probably uttered; but Ambliss and his wife were
both deaf, and they and the servant all slept at
the top of the big house in the front; while poor
Miss Parkway slept at the bottom at the back,
and in a room which was built out from the house
itself.</p>

<p>I had time to hear and notice all this before
the doctor came; and his attendance was of course
a mere matter of form. No one could help or
harm the poor woman now; so, with the information
I had gained, I went to the house of the
nearest magistrate, a very active gentleman and a
solicitor. I ought to have mentioned that the
drawers in which Miss Parkway kept her money
and jewellery were forced open and every valuable
abstracted; the only trace of them being a
few links of a slight chain of a very unusual
pattern, which, with a curious stone, the lady
generally wore round her neck. This chain had
evidently been broken by the violence used, and
parts of it scattered about; the stone was gone.</p>

<p>Information was of course sent to Miss Parkway's
relative who came sometimes to visit her.
And the result of all the inquiries made was
to make things look so very suspicious against
young Lytherly, and so much stress was laid upon
his quarrel with Miss Parkway on her refusal to
lend him money&mdash;which seemed known to everybody&mdash;that
I was obliged to apprehend him. I
didn't want to hurt his feelings; so I went myself
with a fly, although his lodgings were not half a
mile from the town-hall, so as to spare him from
walking in custody through the streets. I found
him at home, looking very miserable, and when
he saw me he said: 'I have been expecting you
all the morning, Mr Robinson; I am very glad
you have come.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'm sorry,' I answered. 'But you may
as well remember that the least said is soonest
mended, Mr Lytherly.'</p>

<p>'Thanks for your caution, old friend,' he says
with a very sickly smile; 'but I shan't hurt myself,
and I feel sure no one else can do so. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">{491}</a></span>
I said I was glad you had come, was because from
Sunday night, when the murder was found out,
until now, middle day on Tuesday, everybody has
shunned me and avoided me as if I had the
plague. I know why, and now it will be over.'</p>

<p>I didn't put handcuffs on him or anything of
that; and when we got into the street he saw the
fly, round which there had already gathered at
least a score of boys and girls, who had, I suppose,
seen me go in. He looked round, and said: 'This
was very thoughtful of you, Mr Robinson; I shall
not forget it.' We drove off, and spoke no more
until we arrived at the town-hall. Here the
magistrates were sitting; and here I found a
tall, dark, grave-looking gentleman talking very
earnestly to Mr Wingrave, our chief solicitor. I
soon found this was Mr Parkway, the cousin of
the murdered lady. He was giving instructions to
the lawyer to spare no expense; to offer a reward
if he thought it necessary; to have detectives
down from London, and goodness knows what.
Mr Wingrave introduced me, and was kind enough
to say that there was no necessity for detectives to
be brought, as they had so eminent a functionary
as myself in the town.</p>

<p>It was supposed that this would be merely
a preliminary examination, but it turned out
differently. A few of Lytherly's companions&mdash;although,
as it transpired afterwards, they fully
believed him guilty&mdash;were yet determined he
should have a chance, and so subscribed a guinea
for old Jemmy Crotton, the most disreputable
old fellow in the town, but a very clever lawyer
for all that; and Jemmy soon came bustling in.
He had a few minutes' conversation with Lytherly,
and then asked that the hearing might be put off
for an hour. This was of course granted; and by
the end of that time he had overwhelming evidence
to prove an alibi; for the landlady's son
hadn't slept a wink for his toothache, and he was
with Lytherly until dinner-time on Sunday; and
then the accused went for a walk with a couple
of friends, and did not return until after dark,
having spent two or three hours at a public-house
some miles off, as the landlord, who happened to
be in the town, it being market-day, helped to
prove; the rest of the time he was in the <i>Bell</i>,
as was usual, poor fellow.</p>

<p>There was no getting over this. There was not
a shadow of pretence for remanding him, and so&mdash;much
to Mr Parkway's evident annoyance&mdash;Lytherly
was discharged. He became more popular
than ever among his associates&mdash;although the
respectable people of the town looked down upon
him&mdash;and they had a supper in his honour that
night, at which old Jemmy Crotton presided. In
default of Lytherly, no clue could be found. Not a
shilling of Miss Parkway's money was ever discovered
in her apartments; so her murderer had
got clear away with his booty. Many wiseacres
said we should hear of Lytherly quietly disappearing
after things had settled down.</p>

<p>Some little excitement was created by Lytherly
attempting to get into the sole funeral carriage
that attended the hearse; but Mr Parkway would
not permit such a thing, and was himself the only
follower. It was very clear that the stranger, in
common with many others, was not half satisfied
with the explanation which had secured Lytherly's
escape; and as I was on the ground at the funeral,
I saw, as did everybody else who was there, the
frown he turned on the young man, who, in spite
of his rebuff, had gone on foot to the churchyard.</p>

<p>Mr Parkway left that evening, having placed his
business in the hands of Mr Wingrave; for as there
was no will, he was the heir-at-law. Now this was
a very curious affair about the will, because Miss
Parkway had told her landlady not many days
before, that she <i>had</i> made her will, and in fact
had shewn her the document as it lay, neatly tied
up, in her desk. However, it was gone now; and
she had either destroyed it, or the person who had
killed her had taken that as well as the money;
and even if the latter was the case, it was hardly
likely to turn up again. So, as I have said, Mr
Parkway went home. The solicitor realised the
poor lady's property; and all our efforts were in
vain to discover the slightest clue to the guilty
party. As for Lytherly, he soon found it was of
no use to think of remaining in Combestead, for
guilty or not, no one of any respectability cared to
associate with him; and, as he owned to me, the
worst part of it all was that old Crotton the
lawyer, whenever they met at any tavern, would
laugh and wink and clap him on the shoulder,
and call upon every one present to remember how
poor old Jemmy Crotton got his young friend off
so cleverly, how they 'flummoxed' the magistrates
and jockeyed the peelers, when it was any odds
against his young friend.</p>

<p>So he went; and a good many declared he had
gone off to enjoy his ill-gotten gains; but I never
thought so; and one of our men going to Chatham
to identify a prisoner, saw Lytherly in the uniform
of the Royal Engineers, and in fact had a
glass of ale with him. The young fellow said it
was his only resource; dig he could not, and to
beg where he was known would be in vain. He
sent his respects to me; and that was the last we
heard for a long time of the Combestead murder.</p>

<h2><a name="A_CURIOUS_PICTURE-BOOK" id="A_CURIOUS_PICTURE-BOOK">A CURIOUS PICTURE-BOOK.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have before us one of the most singular
picture-books that can well be imagined; singular
because unexpected in its character. It is a book
containing the trade-marks of several thousand
merchants, manufacturers, and shopkeepers; each
device printed, in the proper size, from a block or
cast of the original; and the whole collection likely
to be very formidable in dimensions by-and-by.
The system has sprung out of the passing of a
particular Act of Parliament two years ago; and
we shall best facilitate a comprehension of its
nature and purport by glancing at that which
preceded it.</p>

<p>A trade-mark and an armorial bearing have
much the same meaning, however different in
splendour and dignity. Each is a token to distinguish
certain persons from others. In the
middle ages distinguished families and famous
old commercial companies had their marks; so
had monasteries, abbeys, and convents; so had
municipal towns and chartered guilds; so had
merchants and shipowners. By degrees the mark
became embodied as a trade-mark in some instances,
as an heraldic shield or crest or coat-armour
in others. Some noble families at the
present day can shew coats of arms including (in
the device) trade-marks once belonging to the
founder of the family when a trader.</p>

<p>As a feature in legitimate commerce, it is fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">{492}</a></span>
and right for a man to affix to his wares some
mark or symbol to distinguish them from the
wares of other traders. The mark may have a
significant or symbolical meaning, or it may be
wholly fanciful; no matter which, provided it
be his and his only. The range to choose from
is so wide as to be practically limitless; for the
mark may be a name, initial, signature, word,
letter, device, emblem, figure, sign, seal, stamp, or
diagram; and it may be impressed upon or otherwise
attached to a cask, bottle, vessel, canister,
case, cover, envelope, wrapper, bar, plate, ingot,
sheet, bale, packet, band, reel, cork, stopper, label,
or ticket. He must indeed be a difficult man to
please who cannot select out of all these. A quadruped,
bird, or fish; a sun, moon, star, or comet;
a triangle, diamond, square, oval, or hexagon; a
crescent, a castle, a ship; a portrait, medallion, or
profile; a view of a warehouse or of a plantation&mdash;anything
will do, if it suffices to imply 'This is
mine: you must not imitate or forge it.'</p>

<p>No one can glance through the daily papers, in
the columns relating to actions at law, without
seeing evidence how jealously the privileges of
trade-marks are watched by the owners; nor is
it difficult to see why this jealousy is exhibited.
If A possess something which has a money-value
to him, B would like to possess it also if honestly
obtainable, or something sufficiently like it to be
equally advantageous. Unfortunately men do not
always wait to consider how far honesty should
actuate them. There is a vast amount of shabby
peculation on the part of men who avail themselves,
directly or indirectly, of other men's trade-marks,
in order to obtain a share of custom which
does not fairly belong to them. A belief or hope
is entertained that if the public do not know
exactly which is the real Simon Pure, a sham
Simon may perchance come in for some of the
pickings.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, there is a Macassar oil
which has brought a fortune to a particular firm;
another concocter of toilet 'requisites' may be
tempted to adopt the same title, in the hope that
the originator may fail to shew that the Straits of
Macassar have really anything to do with the
matter. If a compounder of pills and ointments
(say Mr Jones) is driving a flourishing trade at a
particular shop, and if another person (also named
Jones) opens a shop close by, and sells similarly
curative pills and ointments, he may hope to trade
partly on the good-luck of the other, and may defy
any one to prove that the surname has been falsely
assumed. If a trader be making a good thing out
of baking powder, and another man wraps up
another (perhaps an inferior) kind of baking
powder in packets printed almost exactly in the
same style and wording, he trusts to an unwary
public being deceived in the matter. No small
difficulty has been felt at times, by judges and
jurors, in determining whether a particular designation
or inscription really deserves the rank of a
trade-mark, and ought to be protected as such. If
a man's name be combined with the name of the
article sold, this would in most cases be a good
trade-mark: such as Day and Martin's blacking,
Delarue's playing-cards, Elkington's electro-plate,
Rimmel's perfumed valentines, Reid's stout, Beaufoy's
vinegar, Fortnum and Mason's hampers,
Crosse and Blackwell's pickles, and the like. But
if there happen to be two men of the same
name in the same trade, then there may possibly
be materials for wrangling, should the men be
disposed to wrangle. It is for this reason that
Dent's watches, Mappin's cutlery, Clarke's coals,
Smith's gin, &amp;c. would not be alone sufficient as
trade-mark designations; because there are two
persons or two firms entitled to use it, something
additional would be needed.</p>

<p>The imitation of a label is one of the most prevalent
modes of displaying the shabby dishonesty of
those who disregard the rights conferred by a trade-mark;
but brands and painted marks are imitated
with equal boldness, if not so frequently. Soda-water
bottles which have in the making been
stamped with the name of a particular firm have,
in like manner, got into the hands of persons who
fill them with soda-water of an obscure and unrenowned
quality. Wine-casks and cigar-boxes,
branded with well-known names, have similarly
been utilised by the sellers of inferior commodities.
As to two Howqua's mixtures, it was shewn that
there was no such person as Howqua concerned in
the matter. Is it true that Birmingham manufacturers
often receive orders from merchants to
make certain goods, and to stamp on them certain
trade-marks belonging to third parties; and that
the manufacturers do this as a matter of course,
'all in the way of business?' Is it true that, in
obedience to orders from wholesale houses in the
Manchester goods-trade, manufacturers will sometimes
put two hundred yards of sewing-thread on
a reel, and paste on it a label denoting three
hundred yards? If so, 'pity 'tis 'tis true.' The
latter of these two ifs does not relate to a trade-mark
piracy, but it is equally indicative of a
shameful disregard of the principles of <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum</i>.</p>

<p>Foreigners have had in past years much reason
to complain of English imitations of labels, inscriptions,
signatures, and trade-marks. Among
metal goods there was one American Company
famed for the really good edge-tools manufactured
by them; they were imitated at Birmingham, so
far as regards a similar mark stamped on each
article, or a similar label attached; of course the
tools, whether good, middling, or bad, were not
what they professed to be; they were worth less in
the market, but were nevertheless sent forth as ifs
made by the original Company&mdash;a bit of sharp
practice very little creditable to the parties concerned.</p>

<p>Most amply have foreigners taken their revenge;
indeed it is not improbable that they first began
this game; seeing that they had more to gain from
a great manufacturing nation than we had to gain
from them in this way. Sheffield has been despoiled
by them in a notable degree. Knives, files,
fish-hooks, needles, &amp;c. made very cheaply of
inferior steel, receive in the German workshops
(more perhaps than in those of France or Belgium)
brands, marks, wrappers, and labels so closely
resembling those of eminent Sheffield firms, as to
deceive all but the most wary. In some instances,
the foreigners have given the go-by to us with an
almost superb audacity: imitating the very notification
on English wrappers that to imitate that
particular trade-mark is felony! Print what they
may, stamp what they may, English manufacturers
of high-class goods find that they cannot ward off
this kind of cheatery&mdash;cheatery, not of money
direct, but of the good reputation which possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">{493}</a></span>
money's worth. However, international trade-mark
laws are doing something to lessen this
unfairness&mdash;of English towards foreigners as well
as of foreigners towards English. Some further
illustrations of these matters will be found in the
volume of this <i>Journal</i> for 1859.</p>

<p>Now for our picture-book.</p>

<p>An Act of Parliament passed two years ago
ordained that from and after a specified date all
new trade-marks must consist of the printed or
impressed or woven name of a particular firm or
individual; or a copy of the written signature of
the party concerned; or distinctive devices, designs,
marks, headings, labels, or tickets. The scope is
sufficiently wide to give an ample choice; but it
must not extend to representations of the Queen,
the royal family, or foreign sovereigns; nor to
royal or national arms, crests, or mottoes; nor to
the arms of cities, boroughs, countries, or families;
nor to representations of prize or exhibition medals;
nor to the use of the words 'trade-mark,' 'patent,'
'warranted,' or 'guaranteed.' No such restrictions,
however, are placed upon any trade-marks that
were in use before the passing of the recent Act.
The Lord Chancellor and the Commissioners of
Patents divide between them the carrying into
effect of the new statute. A new office has been
established for the registry of trade-marks, with
a registrar at its head. The Lord Chancellor has
framed rules and regulations, with a tariff of fees
approved by the Treasury. The registry, when
once granted for a trade-mark, holds good for
fourteen years, and is renewable for equal periods
of fourteen years on the payment of additional fees.
There is so much to pay on application for registry;
then so much for any and every extension to other
classes of goods; then so much if there be two or
more marks for the same article; then so much on
actual registration; then so much for every change
of name or of address; and then so much for a
certificate. The outlay amounts to a good many
pounds altogether, but not approaching the cost of
a patent. The registrar has a certain time allowed
to him between the application and the registration
to make the necessary scrutiny, &amp;c. Every
application for registry, accompanied by a drawing
or engraving, must give an accurate description of
the trade-mark, specifying any words, &amp;c. to which
the applicant attaches special value&mdash;of course
within the limits permitted by the rules.</p>

<p>As one registration of any trade-mark is valid
only for one class of goods, a careful classification
becomes necessary; and this has proved to be one
of the most remarkable features in the system.
Some one's brains, or the brains of more than one,
must have been a good deal exercised in dividing
the whole range of human industry into fifty
classes, and in assigning the contents of each class.
For instance, the first three classes comprise chemical
substances and preparations used in manufactures,
agriculture, and medicine; the fourth resins,
oils, and gums. Then follow three great classes to
include metals, machines, and engines; four more
for instruments and tools of various kinds; and
two for cutlery and edge-tools. Without specifying
each individually, it will suffice to say that two
classes are occupied with works in the precious
metals and jewellery; two with glass and china;
two with building and engineering materials and
appliances; two with arms, ammunition, and
explosives; one for naval equipments and appliances;
and one for land vehicles of all kinds. The
textile branches of industry make a large demand
for classification, in regard to raw materials, yarns,
thread, and piece-goods: three for cotton, three
for flax and hemp, one for jute, three for silk,
three for wool and worsted, and one for carpeting
and rugs. Saddlery and harness require one
class to themselves, so does made-up clothing, so
do india-rubber and gutta-percha goods. Paper,
printing, and bookbinding; furniture and upholstery;
food and ingredients for food; fermented and
distilled liquors; aërated and mineralised beverages;
tobacco, snuff, and cigars; agricultural and
horticultural seeds; candles, matches, lamp-fuel,
and laundry substances; perfumery and toilet
requisites; games and toys of all kinds&mdash;claim
each its own class. Lastly comes class fifty, a
refuge for the destitute, comprising everything
'miscellaneous,' everything for which room cannot
well be found in any of the other classes. The
registrar has sometimes a little difficulty in deciding
to which class a particular trade-mark properly
belongs.</p>

<p>As one of the consequences of the new Act of
Parliament, a <i>Trade-mark Journal</i> has been established
by the Commissioners; and this is our
picture-book. It appears once, twice, or thrice a
week, according to the requirements of the subject,
and (at the time we are now writing) has reached
about its seventieth number, and contains something
like four thousand pictures or representations
of trade-marks. To what extent the collection
will increase by-and-by, no one can form even
a guess. The illustrations relate to the trade-marks
applied for under the new Act; and the Journal
also gives the name and calling of each applicant,
a description of the goods, and a statement of the
length of time during which the mark has been
used. The Journal thus affords all persons interested
in trade-marks authoritative information as
to the nature of the marks used in the respective
trades. A wood-cut block or an electrotype must
be forwarded to the office, representing the particular
trade-mark applied for, if it is to appear in
the Journal; and each quarto page is made up by
printing from several such blocks or casts. Even if
the mark consists only of names and words, still
a block or plate must be sent representing it.</p>

<p>The Master, Warden, Searchers, and Assistants
of the Cutlers' Company at Sheffield possess, in
virtue of ancient charters, very special privileges,
which the new registrar of trade-marks is not
allowed to contravene. He works in harmony
with the Company; and every trade-mark recognised
by the latter may claim of right admission
into the register. To facilitate the granting of
trade-marks for cotton goods, an office has been
established at Manchester for the exhibition of all
marks, devices, headings, labels, tickets, letters,
&amp;c. used in the cotton trade, and locally designated
'cotton-marks' and a committee of experienced
Manchester men decide which among these symbols
or hieroglyphics deserve to be regarded as trade-marks
for registration.</p>

<p>Who can count the varieties of fanciful devices
that make their appearance in our picture-book?
Analogy between the device and the goods is sometimes
attended to; but more frequently it is thrown
overboard altogether. Do we require portraits of
individuals, celebrated or otherwise? Here is a
sarsaparilla man, here one renowned for cod-liver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">{494}</a></span>
oil, and anon a hero of sewing-machines; Sir
Walter Raleigh is brought into requisition by a
tobacco manufacturer; while a cigar-maker, taking
advantage of the recent excitement connected with
a famous picture, adopts a wood-cut copy of Gainsborough's
'Duchess of Devonshire.' Or are we
likely to be smitten with views and landscapes?
We can choose between the Egyptian pyramids
lighted up with an orient sun; a view of Keswick
(near which most of our black-lead for pencils is
obtained); a view of a paper manufactory. In
some sense apposite are a baby in a cradle, for
needle-making; a broken willow-pattern plate, for
a newly warranted cement; the Colossus of Rhodes
[roads], for railway signals; Cupid sharpening his
arrows, for emery-grinding wheels; a smart man
measuring round a smart forehead, for hat-making;
the sun eclipsing nearly everything, for the eclipse
sauce; a dog's head, for fibrine dog-cake; four
nigger plantation minstrels, for cigars; and 'No
place like home' as a trade-mark motto for fenders
and fire-irons.</p>

<p>To account for others, the fancy must make wide
excursions indeed. A maker of edge-tools adopts
stars and crowns, a monkey eating an apple, an
elephant's head, oxen and lions with initials on
their flanks, a negro's head, a cassowary, a boot, a
sledge; and the head of an Aztec accompanied by
the inscription: 'Look for this stamp on each
tool, if you want a genuine article made from
electro-boragic cast-steel.' A locomotive does not
seem specially suitable as a trade-mark for silk
goods; nor a rearing and roaring white lion for
Portland cement; nor a feudal castle for good
hosiery; nor a crowing cock for artificial manure;
nor a helmsman at the wheel for aërated waters;
nor a tearing ranting buffalo for floor-cloth.</p>

<h2><a name="POPPETS_PRANKS" id="POPPETS_PRANKS">POPPET'S PRANKS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Poppet</span>, the subject of the following sketch, was
a little brown monkey, who was for several years
a member of our family. She had no hair on her
face or the palms of her hands&mdash;I say <i>hands</i>, as
they were beautifully formed, with long filbert
nails, very pretty although black, except the
thumb, which certainly was not aristocratic, being
as broad as long. Her feet were like her hands,
but longer, and she could use them with equal
facility. Her eyes were really beautiful, of a clear
golden brown; the nose certainly rather flattened;
and the mouth large, but displaying a set of
beautiful little pearly teeth that many a belle
might have envied. Altogether Poppet was a very
pretty little thing; and when arrayed in a little
tartan dress with white tucker, her hair brushed
neatly, and an amiable expression on her face,
looked very winsome and coaxing; but that expression
could vanish with the swiftness of lightning,
and one the reverse of prepossessing take
its place.</p>

<p>How we lived for the first three months after
her arrival, when she roamed the house at her own
sweet will, has been a source of wonder ever since;
certainly it was in much discomfort; when working,
sitting with our scissors and thread in our
pockets, for if they were placed on the table, in an
instant they were carried to the top of the window
cornice, Poppet's favourite retreat. Sometimes, if
coaxed by an apple, she would drop them; at other
times no blandishments would prevail, and she
would sit drawing her sharp little teeth over the
thread, cutting through every row. If she captured
a paper of pins or needles, she delighted to climb
to the top of a tall plum-tree, where, free from
molestation and deaf to entreaties, she amused herself
by dropping them one by one. One day my
mother entered the bath-room just in time to see
Poppet dart out of the window to a large tree, which
unfortunately grew close by, with a quart bottle
of magnesia in her hand, which she proceeded to
shower down, much amused at the miniature snow-storm,
and not leaving a grain in the bottle. The
meals at that time were most uncomfortable.
When there were eggs for breakfast, we had to
pocket or hide those not in immediate use, or
Poppet would snatch them up and be out of reach
in a moment. As a general rule, when food is
fairly in the mouth, it may be considered safe;
but I have often seen Poppet perch on some
one's shoulder, open the mouth by a sudden jerk
of one hand on the nose, and another on the
chin; then the little brown hand would dive in,
and the contents be transferred to her pouches;
all being done with such extreme rapidity that
strangers used to think it little short of magic.</p>

<p>It was always a terrible business to get Poppet to
bed, having to coax her down by placing an apple
or piece of cake on the table, and then try to seize
her when she approached the decoy; but her movements
were so rapid that this had often to be
repeated several times. At last patience failed, and
it was resolved she should be put to bed at six
o'clock, when she had her last meal, being quite sure
of her then, as she always had a 'goodie,' which
she was allowed to take herself from a bottle of
mixed fruit-drops, kept for her especial delectation.
Poppet evidently regarded the production of this
bottle as the event of the day, but never learnt by
experience that the bottle neck was too narrow to
draw back her hand when quite full, and that it
could only be done if one or two goodies were
seized. Each night she would sit with her little
brown face puckered up into an expression of intense
anxiety as she clutched as large a handful
as possible. After trying ineffectually, she would
draw out two with a sudden dash, and endeavour
to get her hand in again before the stopper was
put on; and her movements were so quick that
she often succeeded!</p>

<p>Everything she stole was transferred to her
pouches. Anything soft, as mashed potato or rice
pudding, she would eagerly cram there, until her
cheeks were quite distended, when she had a
most comical appearance, her face being far
broader than long. When anything small was
lost, the first places examined were Poppet's
pouches. I remember once when she had been
found in my father's dressing-room, they contained
a most wonderful collection, consisting
of two pair of gold studs, half-a-dozen buttons, a
clock-hand much twisted, several large needles
and pins, a piece of toffy, and a small piece of
carrot. Verily, as we used to think, those same
pouches must have been lined with leather.
Poppet had a great objection to a cuckoo clock
we had, and her first performance was to open the
little door at the side, thrust in her arm, drag out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">{495}</a></span>
the poor cuckoo and bite off its head; and it was
a frequent exploit (having broken the glass by
dragging the clock several times off the mantelpiece
on to the floor) to twist up the hands like
cork-screws, giving the poor clock the most demented
expression. Of course it didn't go well.
Who could expect it, after such repeated shocks to
its constitution!</p>

<p>Poppet's bedroom was in a little cupboard under
a washstand; the hot-water pipe passed through it
and made a kind of curve. On this a cushion was
placed; and her ladyship being clothed in a garment
soft and warm, was popped in, shut up with extreme
rapidity, and came out in the morning, as
nurse used to say, 'as warm as a little toast.' When
we first got her, everybody said we should not
keep her over the first winter; but we took such
good care of her that she lived over several winters.
Some of the family, I may observe, did secretly wish
she were not so tenacious of life, or the winters
more severe. Words would fail to mention the
mischief she wrought; the vases and crockery she
smashed; the treasured articles (still retaining
marks of her teeth) she spoiled during her life of
three years with us. She seemed to have the
power of elongating her limbs or throwing out an
extra one in the most mysterious way. If, for
instance, you left her chained to the fender and
returned in about a minute, you were certain
to find Poppet playing with something from the
far end of the room.</p>

<p>She was so immensely strong she frequently
dragged a heavy iron fender across the room and
into the passage; and so cunning, that no knot,
however complicated, could hold her long. Those
cunning little fingers could have unravelled the
Gordian knot itself. If she found she was watched,
she dropped her hands so as to cover what she was
doing, and assumed a vacant expression. She, however,
never could repress a scream of triumph as
she broke loose. Then she would dash round,
knocking over vases and inkpots, and tipping over
glasses generally full of something that would
stain; doing as much mischief in five minutes
as the most terrible child could in a day. Then
ensued a chase, greatly enjoyed on one side, though
not on the other; Poppet springing from picture to
picture, making the cords creak with the sudden
jerk, her chain rapping on the glass of bookcases
and mirrors as she flew along their tops; at last
taking refuge on the cornice, leaving every one
panting and exhausted from the chase and fright.
She was a great source of terror to nervous visitors,
nor was this always unfounded, as on one occasion,
when a lady was leaving the house congratulating
herself that the visit was safely over, Poppet suddenly
made her appearance, and nearly dragged the
bonnet from her head. Another time, when my
mother entered the drawing-room she found a
friend lifting the cloth, and looking under the table.
She explained her peculiar action by saying she
was afraid that dreadful monkey might be there.
I once had a friend Miss G., staying at the house
who took a great dislike to Poppet, and was always
making disparaging remarks anent her little ladyship.
She was always very quick in perceiving
who liked her and who didn't; so this disapproval
she returned with interest. She would creep along
the floor dragging the fender until she could get
hold of Miss G.'s foot, when she would scold at
her in the angriest manner, her eyes glowing with
indignation; and when loose, try to get at her
with great fierceness.</p>

<p>On one occasion Poppet chased Miss G. up-stairs
into her room, and then perched herself on a large
wardrobe close to the door, evidently waiting for
her to come out. Hearing my screams of laughter&mdash;for
Poppet's anger and the lady's fright were most
comical&mdash;she opened the door an inch or two and
was beginning: 'Has that little wretch gone? I
wonder you can keep such an abominable little
brute in'&mdash;&mdash; when she caught sight of Poppet's
wicked grinning little face, just going to launch herself
at the open door, which was closed with a hasty
slam; nor would she venture out until after repeated
assurances that Poppet was safe in her cage, for we
had at last really been obliged to get her one, and
a very strong one too. When she was first put
into it every bar was shaken with all her force;
and not until by frequent trials did she become
convinced that they were beyond her strength.</p>

<p>One of my sisters constituted herself Poppet's
dressmaker. She wore brown holland dresses, bound
with scarlet in summer, and plaid or dark-warm
cloth in winter. One day, however, Maggie's
enthusiasm always to have Poppet well dressed
received a sudden check. She had just completed a
new tartan, when turning away for a moment, she
perceived a strong smell of burning; and found
Poppet had ungratefully consigned the pretty new
dress to the flames. Another time, when we were
removing to a different part of the country, Poppet
was so upset by the noise and confusion, that in
sheer wantonness she laid a pair of boots in the
blazing grate; fortunately they were rescued before
they were much injured.</p>

<p>We shall never forget the consternation that
prevailed when the well-known cry, 'Poppet's
loose!' echoed through the house. Every one flew
to their bedroom to close the window, as, the
house being covered with ivy and surrounded by
trees, the monkey could make exit by any that
happened to be open.</p>

<p>Frequently she did mischievous things in the
most ingenious way. One day, finding a hair
frisette on the stairs, my mother took it to her
room; her sudden entrance startled Poppet, who
bolted out of the window into a cherry-tree,
knocking over and breaking a large mirror, also
leaving three bottles that were on the mantelpiece
pouring their several contents of oil, glycerine,
and Eau de Cologne on to the carpet. Although
Poppet screamed loudly when angry or excited,
she bore pain wonderfully, and never cried out.
Once when she was being chased for stealing some
cough-drops, one of her fingers was put out of joint
in the scrimmage. I rolled her up in a shawl and
took her to the doctor. He must have put her to
considerable pain in putting it in; but except by
frowning very ominously, the creature made no
sign. As soon, however, as I got outside the door,
she turned round and nearly made her teeth meet
in my thumb, evidently thinking: 'There! That's
to pay you out for the pain you have made me
suffer.' And once when, with her on my knee, I was
using a pair of very sharp scissors, she inserted her
finger between the blades, which nearly divided it;
however, she never cried out, but actually bit at
the wound till it bled terribly. She once startled
us by making her appearance in the drawing-room
with face, hands, and feet dyed a brilliant purple.
We found she had upset a bottle of violet ink in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">{496}</a></span>
one of the bedrooms, and had then paddled about
on the white quilt and toilet-cover. The ink being
'permanent,' caused the occupant of that room to
regard the little brown offender with righteous
indignation for some time.</p>

<p>Poppet was extremely conceited, and fond of
'shewing off.' The children of the village school
used regularly to stop before the house to see
the monkey, when she would dance up and down
the boughs of the trees overhanging the lane,
making an occasional wicked dash at the nearest
little one, when the circle would break with
a scamper and scream. She was very jealous of
any child that came to the house, and once when a
baby was the object of general admiration, managed
to pinch its cheek. All the animals seemed
to like her: the cat was her special friend; but
when Pussy had four kittens, Poppet would turn
the poor mother out of her bed, and nurse the
babies herself; and very nicely she did it, sitting up
holding them properly, giving a funny little giggle
when the little furry things tickled her. I am
sorry to say she was not always so gentle, as she
was met dragging a kitten down-stairs by the tip of
its tail, thumping its little head on every step. The
old mother came regularly to say good-morning to
Poppet, making that caressing tone in which a cat
speaks to its kittens. Poppet usually returned the
attention by dragging open Pussy's mouth to see
what she had had for breakfast. When she had
finished her own morning meal, she would sit in
the saucer and rock it up and down; or placing
the saucer on her head, look like a little heathen
Chinee.</p>

<p>At last Poppet got to be too expensive a luxury.
In one week she broke an unusual number of
valuable things. She began the campaign by
dragging the breakfast-room clock and two large
old china bowls off the chimney-piece; of course
the china was smashed to atoms, and the clock
so injured, that ever since its voice has been
most painfully cracked. The next exploit was
to send a large globe spinning down from a
high bookcase, thereby breaking the stand to fragments.
Then in a dance along the hall, she
sprang on to one tip of a pair of immense horns,
bringing them down, and causing them to snap
on each side of the mounting.</p>

<p>Every one's patience was now exhausted, and
'Poppet must be got rid of!' was the universal
cry. A visit was paid to a celebrated menagerie
then in the town; but the monkeys' quarters
were found so cold and dirty, and their little
faces looked so sad and anxious compared to
Poppet's contented well-fed look, that we decided
it was impossible to send her there. It was useless
to offer her to our friends; her fame had blown
far and wide, and how we could keep 'such a
tiresome mischievous creature' was the wonder
of all who knew us. At last it was decided
it would be more merciful to poison her than to
give her where she would be ill-used or ill-fed.
It was a cruel resolve, but what were we to do?
The error had consisted in our ever trying to
domesticate such an untamable creature. Poppet
must die, and in as simple a way as possible.
Prussic acid being said to be instantaneous, was to
be the agent of destruction; and as I was supposed
to have the most nerve in the family, notwithstanding
my objections it was unanimously
resolved I should administer it. The poison remained
under lock and key for some time; at last,
worked up by several dreadful breakages, I gave it
in some grapes, and retired from the room feeling
like a murderer, leaving poor Poppet extended
insensible on the rug. In about half an hour I
returned, expecting to find her quite dead; but
no; there she was, sitting on the fender, scratching
her legs, and looking only a little languid. The
revulsion of feeling was so great, and her invalid
airs so comical and coaxing, that we felt rather
ashamed of having attempted the life of so
winning a creature. I may observe, however, that
that feeling died away as she recovered and the
old amount of mischief went on; and all looked
very blue when some one read 'that monkeys
frequently lived to be a hundred years old;' there
seemed nothing for it but that Poppet should go
as a family heirloom to the only son. Then it
began to be whispered I might try another dose,
but I steadily refused; till at the end of one hot
summer afternoon which I had spent in my room,
I went down-stairs, to find my mother looking
very white, and hear her say: 'If I had known
you were in the house I wouldn't have done it;'
and to find that poor Poppet had been very effectually
'done for' at last; that for the first time in
her little tricksy roguish life she was really quiet.
She was buried in the garden, and a headstone
with a suitable inscription erected to her memory.</p>

<p>Now that the anguish for the loss of old friends
(in glass and china) has been blunted by time,
as we sit round the fire 'between the lights,' the
recital of Poppet's pranks is listened to with rapt
attention by the children; and I often think, with
Frank Buckland, that many a more valuable
friend may be less missed and less sincerely
mourned than a pet monkey.</p>
